# clueso-clone
This project is a simple frontend clone of Clueso that simulates a product assistant chatbot. Users can type keywords like pricing, refund, support, and features to get instant responses. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it focuses on clean UI, chat flow, and fast keyword-based problem solving.
